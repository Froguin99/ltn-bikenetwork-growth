## So I don't forget to update after a new package is downloaded!

- open Miniforge Prompt
- mamba info --envs
- mamba activate C:\Users\b8008458\AppData\Local\miniforge3\envs\growbikenet
- mamba env export --no-builds > "C:\Users\b8008458\OneDrive - Newcastle University\2022 to 2023\PhD\networkGrowth\bikenwgrowth\environment.yml"
- remove file name at very bottom of file
- libcurl (remove version)

- check for against MacOS environment for differances
